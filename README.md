# Dental-Caries-in-Panoramic-X-ray
Dental caries in a panoramic x-ray appear as dark areas (radiolucent) in teeth, indicating decay. It starts as demineralization of enamel due to acid from bacteria, progressing to deeper layers. Treatment involves filling cavities to restore tooth structure. Regular check-ups can prevent further decay.
